# IMDb Dataset

This dataset is from the Internet Movie Database ([IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)), one of the world's most popular and authoritative sources for movie, TV, and celebrity content, and contains comprehensive movie and TV-show information.

The raw data, and more information about the dataset, can be found at [developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
