# Stack Overflow Dataset

This dataset contains comprehensive Stack Overflow content from the world's largest online community for programmers to learn, share their knowledge, and advance their careers. Updated on a quarterly basis, this BigQuery dataset includes an archive of Stack Overflow content, including posts, votes, tags, and badges.

This public dataset is hosted in [Google BigQuery]([url](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)) and is included in BigQuery's 1TB/mo of free tier processing. The dataset is updated to mirror the Stack Overflow content on the Internet Archive, and is also available through the Stack Exchange Data Explorer.

For convenience, we have included the first 100 rows of each dataset in [data_tops](https://github.com/SnowLeopard-AI/discord_datasets/tree/main/stack-overflow/data_tops). You can also query the full dataset directly using [BigQuery's free tier](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/stack-exchange/stack-overflow).
