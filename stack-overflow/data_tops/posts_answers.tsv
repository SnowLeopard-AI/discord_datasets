This may not be the answer for you, though, since this does not work if the class you are monkey-patching is already in a namespace.
I haven't figured out how to get around that, other than trimming the namespace declaration from the eval string.  However, doing so would likely break any namespace-dependent code within the class methods.</p>

  <p>Sounds great, but what about the missing features that you might want to know about for your situation:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em><strong>no <code>&lt;OPTGROUP ..&gt;</code> support.</em></strong> Possible to implement.</li>
  <li>no complex per-item content, such as multiple images or HTML. A single block <code>&lt;LI .. &gt;</code> with background image, hover/active class and CSS is all you get - performance is more important sorry.</li>
  <li>no support for multiple selection, i.e. <code>&lt;SELECT multiple .. &gt;</code>. (thetoolman) doesn't recommend them as a good UI widget: ctrl + click for form entry? no thanks. Use checkboxes or some better metaphor!</li>
  <li>no JSON/ajax/ajax-autocomplete support. This is just a wrapper on a <code>&lt;SELECT.. &gt;</code> tag, so you can modify or inject new <code>&lt;OPTION ..&gt;</code>s to the master via any technique/tool you prefer, then simply trigger a reload from that master <code>&lt;SELECT ..&gt;</code> :)</li>
  <li>limited backwards compatibility with sexy-combo configuration, CSS, callbacks etc. if you are upgrading. The transition should be easy however, as the included skins use the same file layout more or less.</li>
  <li>many events are not passed on, such as key events. Welcome use-case suggestions for event mimicing of other types.</li>
  <li>Not yet tested with screen-readers and other special access techniques. Gladly accept suggestions, especially with the dummy ARIA-enabled themeroller test in the current demo page linked above. </li>

10183387		<p>Late answer, but I've just experienced this myself and am having a few issues.  As far as style sheets or JS files (basically any static resource) not being found after using a path variable, I was able to fix that by prefixing all of my style sheet or JS file links with ${pageContext.request.contextPath}.  This ensures that the server always searches for them from WebContent, rather than from the offending path variable.  I am also now having the issue of not being able to send proper requests to the other pages, but as my controllers only return Strings for the view resolver rather than ModelAndView objects, I'm not sure your solution will fit for me.</p>			0		2012-04-17 00:11:23.120000 UTC		2012-04-17 00:11:23.120000 UTC					1134899	7933744	2	0

10183711		"<p>After some more research and experimenting, I was able to actually solve the issue.  I had tried playing with the Date constructor and such, but I didn't have much luck in my initial trials - apparently because I overlooked the fact that the Date object is unique in that it differs in functionality depending on how it is called (as a function or object constructor).  This means that you can't just do <code>Date.prototype.constructor.apply(this, arguments)</code> since all you'll ever get back is a string (the Date object is being called as a function).</p>

<p>After having found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/181348/instantiating-a-javascript-object-by-calling-prototype-constructor-apply"">this thread</a> and reading it, I came up with the following code that creates an actual Date object (or string if called as a function) and mimics the built-in Date object perfectly (as far as my tests show anyways).  Every time a new Date object is created, it gets the LCID property which is dynamically generated during object creation which is exactly what I needed.</p>

<pre><code>Date = (function(orig) {
    var date = function(a, b, c, d, e, f, g) {
        var object = (this instanceof Object ? (arguments.length &lt; 1 ? new orig() : (arguments.length &lt; 2 ? new orig(a) : (arguments.length &lt; 4 ? new orig(a, b || 0, c || 1) : new orig(a, b, c, d || 0, e || 0, f || 0, g || 0)))) : orig());
        object.LCID = Response.LCID;

        return object;
    };
    date.prototype = orig.prototype;

    return date;
})(Date);
</code></pre>

<p>I also created a bunch of test cases to ensure that there is no difference from a built-in Date object, or using this code (comment out this code to see the results using the built-in Date object and compare).</p>

<pre><code>var Response = { 'LCID': 123 };


Date = (function(orig) {
    var date = function(a, b, c, d, e, f, g) {
        var object = (this instanceof Object ? (arguments.length &lt; 1 ? new orig() : (arguments.length &lt; 2 ? new orig(a) : (arguments.length &lt; 4 ? new orig(a, b || 0, c || 1) : new orig(a, b, c, d || 0, e || 0, f || 0, g || 0)))) : orig());
        object.LCID = Response.LCID;
        return object;
    };
    date.prototype = orig.prototype;
    return date;
})(Date);

<pre><code>if ( $password != $copasswd ) {
   $display_msg = $messages['usr_pass_notmached']
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your HTML do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;?php echo $display_msg?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the variable is empty then nothing is displayed.  If you do this for all the fields, then you can ensure all the information from the form is returned on error, whether the actual field IS the error or not, preventing the user from having to retype all the information again.  Have the form do a <code>$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']</code> to ensure it reloads the same page</p>

<p>I would build the PHP functionality (which can't be turned off by the user) and ensure your form works properly 100% (or close to that) of the time.  Then, once you have that script working, add your JS funcionality to <em>compliment</em> your existing code.</p>

<p>What I do in mine, is I build an extra array, in this case <code>$display_msg</code> and I run a check of all the input fields.  If a field fails, I add that to the array, <code>$display_msg['password']</code> then I move on to the next field.  Once all the fields have been check, I check if the <code>$display_msg</code> variable is <code>empty</code> or not.  If it's not empty, then I have it fill all the <code>span</code> next to the input boxes with red letters explaining the error.  This will print out ALL of the errors at the same time, instead of one at a time while it works it's way down the form.  Next to each input I have a <code>span</code> with the given variable name, in this instance <code>&lt;?php echo $display_msg['password']?&gt;</code>, then next to the username, <code>&lt;?php echo $display_msg['username']?&gt;</code> and so on.

<p>When you add an ImageView and provide a source to it, or add the image later programatically, the ImageView resizes itself according to the dimensions of the image. But at times when the source image is larger than the screen size, it is scaled according to the scaleType (if provided) or just scales the image so that the largest side fits the screen completely and the other side is scaled keeping the dimension intact.</p>

<p>But after the image is inserted into the ImageView, the Bounds of the ImageView is not adjusted automatically to the newly scaled image. For this there is another parameter in the ImageView called <code>android:adjustViewBounds</code></p>

<p>So try doing this in your Imageview.</p>

<p>It will help you cross compile and build a universal library that contains the arm6/arm7/i386 all in the one statically linked library so it should work on simulator and device and be suitable for AppStore distribution.</p>

<p>Also if you have XCode 4.3 or higher beware and read the comments about how the developer directory has changed.</p>"			0		2012-04-17 01:17:17.410000 UTC		2012-04-17 01:17:17.410000 UTC					622276	8969699	2	0
