253764,,<p><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc309370.aspx rel= nofollow >The MSDN documentation for Policy Injection</a> has a pretty clear explanation:</p> <blockquote> <p>Applications include a mix of business logic and crosscutting concerns and the two are typically intermingled—which can make the code harder to read and maintain. Each task or feature of an application is referred to as a concern. Concerns that implement the features of an object within the application such as the business logic are core concerns. Crosscutting concerns are the necessary tasks features or processes that are common across different objects—for example logging authorization validation and instrumentation. The purpose of the Policy Injection Application Block is to separate the core concerns and crosscutting concerns.</p> </blockquote> <p>Simply put the PI block lets developers define a set of policies that specify the behavior of objects in the system. So your core business logic such as the code that calculates profit per unit in a fiscal year (one concern) is separated from the logging of that execution of logic (another but more often used concern). </p> <p>The same documentation says that the PI block is <em>not</em> AOP because:</p> <ul> <li>It uses interception to enable only pre-processing handlers and post-processing handlers. </li> <li>It does not insert code into methods. </li> <li>It does not provide interception for class constructors. </li> </ul> <p>So trying to look at PI from an AOP perspective can muddy the waters a bit.</p>,,,0,,2008-10-31 14:44:04.403000 UTC,,2008-10-31 14:44:04.403000 UTC,,,,Robert S.,7565,73487,2,2,,

If the guess is wrong this will likely blow up with an exception or the decoder will 'disappear' some characters. </p> <p>Creating a decoder along the lines you describe (modifying <code>cp1252.py</code>) is easy. You just need to define the translation table from bytes to Unicode characters.</p> <p>However if not all of the text in the database has the same encoding your decoder will need some rules to decide which is the correct mapping. In this case you may want punt and use the <a href= http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet rel= nofollow ><strong>chardet module</strong></a> which can scan the text and make a guess the encoding.</p> <p>Maybe the best approach would be try to decode using the most likely encoding (cp1252) and if that fails fallback to using chardet to guess the correct encoding.</p> <p>If you use <code>text.decode()</code> and/or chardet you'll end up with a Unicode string. Below is a simple routine which can translate characters in a Unicode string e.g. convert curly quotes to ASCII :</p> <pre><code>CHARMAP = [ (u'\u201c\u201d' ' ') (u'\u2018\u2019' ' ) ] # replace with text.decode('cp1252') or chardet text = u'\u201cit\u2019s probably going to work\u201d he said' _map = dict((c r) for chars r in CHARMAP for c in list(chars)) fixed = ''.join(_map.get(c c) for c in text) print fixed </code></pre> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code> it's probably going to work  he said </code></pre>,,,0,,2011-04-28 13:56:30.043000 UTC,,2011-04-29 21:30:26.957000 UTC,2011-04-29 21:30:26.957000 UTC,,538718,,538718,5819586,2,0,,

37599662,,<p>Boost.Log composes the file name in the encoding that is native for the underlying operating system. On Windows the file name is a UTF-16 string (the character type is <code>wchar_t</code>) on most POSIX systems it is typically UTF-8 (the character type is <code>char</code>).</p> <p>In order to produce the file name in the native encoding the <a href= http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/log/doc/html/boost/log/sinks/file/as_file_name_composer.html rel= nofollow ><code>as_file_name_composer</code></a> adapter creates a stream that performs character code conversion as needed when the adapted formatter is invoked. This basically lets you use both narrow and wide strings in the formatter as long as the encoding can be converted to the native one. You have to know though that the same-typed strings are assumed to have the same encoding so if the native multibyte encoding is UTF-8 then all your narrow strings must also be UTF-8.</p> <p>When character code conversion happens the stream uses a locale that you can provide as the second argument for <code>as_file_name_composer</code>. By default the locale is default-constructed. If your default-constructed locale is not UTF-8 then the conversion will produce incorrect result which I think is what's happening.

28123809,,<p>We ended up going with Subprocess from the FB folly library since we had recently added folly as a dependency anyway. They use <code>vfork()</code> under the hood which forks the process without making a copy of the process's pages and freezes the parent process until the child exec()'s.</p> <p><code>vfork()</code> has many potential pitfalls and seems to be widely considered deprecated/dangerous to use. For example it requires that the forked process do nothing other than exec; because the process's pages are shared if any memory is modified they can modify and corrupt the parent's state. Having it abstracted in a carefully-programmed library should make it much easier to avoid mistakes when we simply want to launch a process without memory overhead.</p> <p>Header for the folly Subprocess library: <a href= https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/Subprocess.h rel= nofollow >https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/Subprocess.h</a></p>,,,0,,2015-01-24 08:48:10.663000 UTC,,2015-01-24 08:48:10.663000 UTC,,,,,133518,27307345,2,0,,
