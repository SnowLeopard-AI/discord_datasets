5130474		"<p>Ramaze is a web application framework created by Michael Fellinger (also known as manveru) for Ruby. The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">KISS</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise"" rel=""nofollow"">POLS</a>, trying to make simple things simple and complex things possible. This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some Ruby, but is often forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features. Ramaze only tries to give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achieve perfect custom-tailored results. </p>

<p>Another one of the goals during development of Ramaze was to make every part as modular and therefore reusable as possible, not only to provide a basic understanding after the first glance, but also to make it as simple as possible to reuse parts of the code. </p>

<p>The original purpose of Ramaze was to act as a kind of framework to build web-frameworks, this was made obsolete by the introduction of rack, which provides this feature at a better level without trying to enforce any structural layout of the resulting framework.</p>

<h2>Basic Example</h2>

<pre><code>require 'ramaze'

class MainController &lt; Ramaze::Controller
  def index
    ""Hello, Ramaze!""
  end
end

Ramaze.start
</code></pre>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installing Ramaze is super easy when using Rubygems:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install ramaze
</code></pre>

<p>Once the gem is installed you can create a new application using the ""ramaze"" binary:</p>

<pre><code>$ ramaze create myapp
</code></pre>

Logger: The main entity on which applications make logging calls. A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component.
LogRecord: Used to pass logging requests between the logging framework and individual log handlers.</p>

<p>Handler: Exports LogRecord objects to a variety of destinations including memory, output streams, consoles, files, and sockets. A variety of Handler subclasses exist for this purpose. Additional Handlers may be developed by third parties and delivered on top of the core platform.</p>

<p>Level: Defines a set of standard logging levels that can be used to control logging output. Programs can be configured to output logging for some levels while ignoring output for others.</p>

<p>Filter: Provides fine-grained control over what gets logged, beyond the control provided by log levels. The logging APIs support a general-purpose filter mechanism that allows application code to attach arbitrary filters to control logging output.</p>

  <p>Cua-mode allows one to use ‘C-v’, ‘C-c’, and ‘C-x’ to paste, copy, and cut the region. Since this conflicts with very important keybindings in Emacs, these CUA bindings are only active when the mark is active. The package does a whole lot more, too: ‘C-z’ to undo, Shift-movement to select, and it includes support for rectangular regions (‘C-RET’ and arrow keys instead of using the <code>C-x r …’ keys) and registers (instead of using the register commands), and it uses</code>’ and `S-’ to indent and outdent the region.

<p><strong>Code block</strong> is a section of code which is grouped together. Code blocks consist of one or more declarations and statements.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The function of code blocks in programming is to enable groups of
  statements to be treated as if they were one statement, and to narrow
  the lexical scope of variables, procedures and functions declared in a
  block so that they do not conflict with variables having the same name
  used elsewhere in a program for different purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notion of blocks is introduced by different syntax in different languages, but there are two broad families: </p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>ALGOL</strong> family in which blocks are delimited by the keywords <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>, and </li>
<li>The <strong>C</strong> family in which blocks are delimited by curly braces <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>A programming language that permits the creation of blocks, including blocks nested within other blocks, is called a <strong>block-structured programming language</strong>.  </p>

<p>In a block-structured programming language, the names of variables and other objects such as procedures which are declared in outer blocks are visible inside other inner blocks, unless they are shadowed by an object of the same name</p>"			0		2013-01-10 06:03:09.263000 UTC		2013-01-10 06:25:50.873000 UTC	2013-01-10 06:25:50.873000 UTC	user966588		user966588			5	0

14523238		"<p><a href=""http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance"" rel=""nofollow""><code>isinstance</code></a> is a Python built-in function used to test whether or not a specific object is an instance of a particular class or type.  It is available in both versions 2 and 3.  Use this tag for questions explicitly dealing with the isinstance built-in.</p>

<p>The schematics for the function are below:</p>

<pre><code>isinstance(object, class-or-type-or-tuple) -&gt; bool
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>object</code> is the object to test and <code>class-or-type-or-tuple</code> is a class, type, or tuple of classes and/or types.  </p>

<p>When invoked, and given a single class or type as its second argument, the function will return either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on whether or not the first argument is an instance of the second.  Below is a demonstration:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(1, int)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(1, str)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the function is given a tuple of classes and/or types as its second argument, it will return either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on whether or not the first argument is an instance of <em>any</em> of the classes/types contained in the tuple. Below is a demonstration:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance('a', (int, str))
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance('a', (int, bool))
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It should also be noted that the following code:</p>

<pre><code>isinstance('a', (int, str))
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to this:</p>

<pre><code>isinstance('a', int) or isinstance('a', str)

17720461		"<p>The term ""name collision"" has been used in computer science for more than 3 decades, when referring to names in various classification systems. Most of the time, a name collision must be resolved immediately in some way, whether automatically by an operating system or compiler or manually through user input and decisions. The concept of a namespace sometimes resolves collision issues by creating different logical regions in which items with similar names can co-exist without ambiguity. In certain programming instances, a name collision might not be immediately evident, occasionally leading to hard-to-find program errors that can result from the compiler making certain assumptions about the names of items used.</p>

<p>An example of how a name collision can occur involves two directories full of files. If each directory contains a file named ""DATA"", and the contents of one directory are copied into the other, then the computer's attempts to copy the file named DATA will find that a file with the same name already exists in the target directory. This creates a name collision. In this instance, the user usually will be prompted and allowed to choose from a list of resolutions, including renaming one of the files, not copying the file or overwriting one of the files.</p>

<p>One commonly used solution for a name collision is the implementation of namespaces. A namespace is simply a way to define an area under which object names are contained. In the above example, a directory technically is a namespace, meaning multiple files can all have the same name as long as they are each in different directories.</p>

<p>From a programming perspective, a name collision can occur in situations such as multiple inheritance, overlapping variable scopes, or even with imported libraries in some languages. In general, a compiler will notice a conflict and generate a warning or error, although this might not always be the case. Other than using namespaces, collisions in many programming languages can be avoided by using qualifiers. A qualifier usually is a prefix that can be placed in front of a variable or class name to distinguish it from another variable with the same name.</p>"			0		2013-07-18 10:06:41.810000 UTC		2013-07-18 10:58:21.530000 UTC	2013-07-18 10:58:21.530000 UTC	user2140173		user2140173			5	0

<p>Here are some definitions of posterization:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterization"" rel=""nofollow"">Posterization</a> of an image entails conversion of a continuous gradation of tone to several regions of fewer tones, with abrupt changes from one tone to another. This was originally done with photographic processes to create posters. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/posterization.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Posterization</a> occurs when an image's apparent bit depth has been decreased so much that it has a visual impact. The term posterization is used because it can influence your photo similar to how the colors may look in a mass-produced poster, where the print process uses a limited number of color inks. This effect ranges from subtle to quite pronounced, although one's tolerance for posterization may vary.</p>

<p>AQuery stands for Android Query, which is a small though powerful library for doing <strong>asynchronous tasks</strong> and <strong>manipulating UI elements</strong> in Android.  AQuery is an <strong><code>open source project</code></strong> that contains library files for Android developers that makes doing repetitive tasks easier.</p>

<p>Android Query simplifies attaching event handlers. Rather than building out an interface or anonymous class. When working with different screen sizes Android Query lets you side-step inspection of the visual tree to see which controls were actually created from the <code>axml</code> file before you attempt to manipulate them by using conditional chaining of methods.</p>

<p>A friend function in a <strong><code>C++</code></strong> class is defined outside the scope of a class but it has the right to access all <code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> members of the class. Even though the prototypes for friend functions appear in the class definition, friends are not member functions.</p>

<p>To declare a function as a friend of a class, precede the function prototype in the class definition with keyword friend as follows</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>// friend_functions.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;
class Point
{
    friend void ChangePrivate( Point &amp; );
public:
    Point( void ) : m_i(0) {}
    void PrintPrivate( void ){cout &lt;&lt; m_i &lt;&lt; endl; }

private:
    int m_i;
};

void ChangePrivate ( Point &amp;i ) { i.m_i++; }

int main()
{
   Point sPoint;
   sPoint.PrintPrivate();
   ChangePrivate(sPoint);
   sPoint.PrintPrivate();
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Tag usage</h2>

<p>The tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/friend-function"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'friend-function'"" rel=""tag"">friend-function</a> can be used for programming related problems in implementation of friend functions, Theoretical questions such as <strong>""How to use friend functions""</strong> should be avoided </p>

19040122		"<p><strong>Seriously.js</strong> is a real-time, node-based video compositor for the web.</p>

<p>Inspired by professional software such as After Effects and Nuke, Seriously.js renders high-quality video effects, but allows them to be dynamic and interactive.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p><strong>WebGL</strong></p>

<p>Seriously.js requires a browser that supports WebGL. Development is targeted to and tested in Firefox (4.0+) and Google Chrome (9+). Safari and Opera are expected to support WebGL in the near future. There are no public plans for Internet Explorer to support WebGL.</p>

<p>Even though a browser may support WebGL, the ability to run it depends on the system's graphics card. Serioulsy.js is heavily optimized, so most modern desktops and notebooks should be sufficient. Older systems may run slower, especially when using high-resolution videos.</p>

<p>Mobile browser support for WebGL is limited. Mobile Firefox has some support, but the Android Browser and Mobile Safari do not.</p>

<p>Seriously.js provides a method to detect browser support and offer descriptive error messages wherever possible.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Origin Videos and Images</strong></p>

<p>Due to security limitations of WebGL, Seriously.js can only process video or images that are served from the same domain, unless they are served with CORS headers. Firefox 12 and up support CORS for video but other browsers do not, and videos served with CORS are rare. So for now, it is best to host your own video files.</p>
