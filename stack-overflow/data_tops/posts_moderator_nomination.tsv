<p>I am often found in the SO chatrooms, the MSO chatrooms, and on some of the SE chatrooms.

<p>That would be true if I were asking to be a SOIS - Community Senator or something, but I'm really just looking to be a better janitor. I already flag questions for close, suggest comments on how to make other questions better, edit titles/tags/questions, and generally help with the upkeep. But I would be happy to take that one step further and help a little more, because I believe in SOIS and the mission to make the internet a better place.</p>

<p>Of course, I also realize that I could just be some power hungry guy looking to make a name for himself as a ruthless mod, exacting bloody vengeance throughout the community as tho I were the grim reaper and my mod abilities were my scythe. But with Jeff on the horizon, I doubt anyone could pull that stunt at this point, even if they were so inclined.

Even on days when I can't find the questions to answer or the time to answer them, I'm still here browsing the content.  Learning from others, helping to moderate (voting to close or migrate, leaving hopefully helpful comments on questions for which I don't otherwise have an answer, and so on), sometimes just bumming around and looking for a way to contribute.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It is sickening, the reverence with which you speak of the liars and thieves whose feet are so firmly planted on your necks. You call the congressmen and the judges ‘honorable,’ and you swoon at the magnificence of the grandiose halls they inhabit, like this one, the temples they built to celebrate the domination of mankind. You feel pride at being able to say you once shook a senator’s hand, or saw the President in person. Ah, yes, the grand deity himself, His Royal Highness, the President of the United States of America.
You speak the title as if you’re referring to God Almighty. The vocabulary has changed a bit, but your mindset is no different from that of the groveling peasants of old who bowed low, faces in the dirt, with a feeling of unworthiness and humility, when in the presence of whatever narcissist had declared himself to be their rightful lord and master. The truth of the matter, back then and today, is that these parasites who call themselves ‘leaders’ are not superior beings, they are not great men and women, they are not honorable, they’re not even average.</p>

4729709		"<p>Stackoverflow is a huge part of my life, and I want to do everything in my power to make it better. I've spent enough time on other sites to know why SO is so special and how it truly excels. Stackoverflow has been one of the greatest things that has happened to the programming world in the past two years, and its been of a massive help to so many people.</p>

<p>However, I know there is always room for improvement, and with a community this powerful and dedicated, anything is possible. I came here a total beginner, and although I still have a long way to go, I've seen so many unique aspects of SO on my journey through programming. There's truly no other site where people can have fun, learn, and teach and have fun while talking about the subject they truly love like stackoverflow. This site is something special that happens once in a lifetime, and I want to do everything I can to make it the best place it can be.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time on meta, the blog, and area51, and I want to be there for every step stackoverflow takes so I can be of as much of a help as possible, either as a moderator, teacher, or just a plain participator in the community. All of them are great honors that I am happy to have. I know what the site looks like from a total beginner's point of view because I sort of grew up here. I know how people feel to get downvoted for bad posts, how it feels to get questions closed, and how it feels when somebody greets you with a smile and takes time to try to help you understand. </p>

<p>Moderation is not about the posts, its about the people who will make and read the posts. Its a moderator's responsibility to educate other users about the site and help them understand how things work. The buttons granted to you represent the people's trust in you to control their experience. Making that experience as good as possible is <em>always</em> your goal. Hence, moderation should be done as lightly as possible, and the community should be able to weigh in as much as possible on moderator decisions. Comments that explain what you are thinking about doing and why are vital for both the poster and the viewer, because they ultimately educate the community and make sure that you are doing what they want and helping them as much as possible, and only with the community's feedback can I know if I'm doing my job correctly.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Short Version:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would love to have the honor to help make SO better, even though everyone with an account really has that privilege. </li>
<li>I've grown up here, so I've seen things from many different angles.</li>
<li>Moderation privileges should be an <em>extension</em> of other user's power in the community. The community makes the decisions as to what should truly happen, the moderators are just the workers that try to keep up and meet their desires as much as possible and push the buttons to make things happen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the community chooses me, although I know my chances are slim with all the other bright and dedicated people here, I promise I will do all to make this place even more awesome.  :D</p>

<p>My journey on SO began in Dec 2009. While working on a hobby project I was looking for ways
to parse HTML. I posted my <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/1881237/227665"">first question</a> asking how to use regex to parse and extract from HTML :) One of the comments had a link to the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454"">all time famous answer of why not to parse HTML using
regex</a>. I spent the entire evening reading it and other top Q&amp;A. That day sort
of triggered a programming knowledge chain reaction which is going on
till today. SO is certainly one of the best things that has happened to
programming and programmers.</p>

<p>I've been around here for just over a year now. I've learnt a lot of things from this site and it's time to give something back to the community.</p>

<p>I think I've made good use of the moderator tools currently available
to me. You can see me re-tagging, re-framing, formatting, migrating questions whenever I'm online. My special focus being on new users who are not quite aware of how the site functions.
I'll be honored to have the added responsibility of a moderator.</p>

<p>Some things about me you'd like to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>I visit the site almost everyday.</li>
<li>I know the site inside out.</li>
<li>I spend a lot of time reading old
posts and improving them if necessary.</li>
<li>I'm active across decent number of tags.</li>
<li>I've Electorate, Copy Editor,
Fanatic, Sportsmanship, Pundit and
Generalist badges.<br>Gold badge in C, PHP, C++, Java and Regex and Silver badge in Perl.</li>
<li>I visit meta frequently and have read almost all discussions going on there but
I've not actively participated in meta Q&amp;A.</li>
<li>Available mostly between 0900hrs to 1900hrs
IST </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any question I'll be happy to answer.</p>

strange interest in being the first one to read it!</li>

<li><p>I have experience moderating: I've moderated other web sites before and I'm a college and high school teacher.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being patient when somebody can't see the error of his ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Dealing appropriately with major infractions.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning how to approach people committing minor infractions.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyzing reactions to your own moderation.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm very active on Meta, SO and SU, so I have a solid understanding on how a moderator should operate.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm very interested in SO itself. My rep on Meta is higher than my rep on SO, and I have tag badges for <code>support</code> and <code>discussion</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I have <strong>a lot</strong> of spare time that I spend on the SE network anyway.</p></li>

<p>Working for a organisation that demands patience as a key skill, over the years I have become very good at listening to all parties arguments and deciding not the facts that are in front of me, I am not the type to be socially persuaded into a decision. </p>

<p>I believe in myself that my listening skills are good in comparison to many other members of stack overflow members. </p>

<p>Some details about myself: </p>

<ul>
<li>Name: Robert Pitt </li>
<li>Age: 22 </li>
<li>Some Skills: Programming, Networking, Infrastructure, Problem Solving, Team Management </li>
<li>Interests: Computer Science, Programming, Latest Technologies, Sports, Pint in the pub, Enjoying Life, Socialising. </li>
</ul>

<p>A short Biography: 
I'm a young enthusiastic person who thrives on becoming great at anything I find interesting, I work for the Children's Services across the UK where I work with Information Communication Technology as a Manager for the Infrastructure and Innovations team. </p>

<p>But under all that I'm actually a relaxed guy who likes to be with mates, going to the pub and talking about Music, Life, Women etc.</p>

<p>Something you may notice about my profile is that i have several answers with 0 votes, several answers with minus votes, I would just like you to know that this is not down to poor answers (although sometimes when I'm tired I can make mistakes) but the fact that even though I'm incorrect I leave my answers up where others would delete them if they start getting down votes.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that SO is not about reputation, Its not about being right all the time, its about providing the less knowledgeable with a set of answers that are marked accordingly to there correctness, so that the user knows what's correct <em>as well</em> as what's incorrect. </p>

<p>On SO there is only need for little intervention when when it comes to moderation and knowing when that intervention should be is a key factor in keeping peace within the community.</p>

<p>From the past sites that I have run as well as moderated I have learnt that moderators need to be considerate as well as vigilant, Within my life I have been known to be able to talk any single person and be able to read there character and personality and respond with the correct tone,manner and body language to be able to keep a certain level of respect.</p>

<p>I believe that bringing some of these skills into the community I would be able to gain respect and order from the community.</p>

<p>Finally I would just like to say that I'me not perfect, and if you expected the perfect moderator I would withdraw my proposal, I expect to make mistakes and I look forward to making mistakes as this is the only true way to gain experience and knowledge.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to review this post. </p>

<h2>Stances on moderation</h2>

<p>In case you can't make it to the <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=schedule"">next two town hall chats for the candidates</a>, I figured I'd answer some of the <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=stars"">most popular questions posed to candidates at the last town hall chat for election</a>:</p>

<p>I've been a Microsoft MVP for over ten years; one of the tenants of the award is professionalism, and our activities in the peer-to-peer space are monitored to see if we maintain that professionalism.  </p>

<p>I've been under the microscope for a long time, and I've not expected that to end anytime soon.  It's natural for me; common courtesy and professionalism are always integral to how I approach anything, whether on SO or elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously though, there <em>will</em> be a learning curve, and I will be aggressive in ""getting over the hump"" as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In that time, however, I will approach issues I am unsure about the way I would any other, collaborating with my peers, learning in the process, and abstaining until I am convinced that the course of action is the best one for the community.</p>

<p>If I had to put a hard number on it, I'd say somewhere between one to two months (that might be a little aggressive, but I've yet to experience the full breadth and width of what I'll have to pick up).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288749#288749"">Would you suspend a user who repeatedly posts replies to their

  you take instead, if any?</a> - <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/users/89334/waiwai933"">waiwai993</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the user's intent; if it's clear that the user is flagrantly disregarding proper procedure in the face of being politely told otherwise, then yes, I would suspend a user.  How long would be dependent on the user's activity, it would have to be a period long enough to have an impact.</p>

<p>Suspending a user for a day when they come to the site once every two weeks will have little effect.</p>

<p>If I cannot find any information that the user has been informed of the proper procedure then I will do so in the comments, suggesting that the user add it as a comment.  I'd then monitor the user's behavior for a little bit, and inform my fellow moderators about that user's activities.</p>

<p>I like to help. It's why I was awarded an MVP position (another tenant, helping others in a peer-to-peer environment).  It's why I created <a href=""http://sf4answers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">sf4answers</a>.</p>

<p>The more ability I am given to help individuals or groups as a whole, I take.  Being a moderator will allow me to bring a better SO experience to all and I'd take it as a source of pride to be able to say I helped do that in some small way.</p>

<p>And I like diamonds. =)</p>

  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288915#288915"">Do you think it's the role of the moderator to calm down

</blockquote>

<p>If it is a singular comment/answer, etc, then it might be able to be easily defused by a polite comment, and it takes little time to do that.  While one might be a moderator, that doesn't mean that one should bring the sledgehammer down when a regular hammer will do.</p>

<p>If it's a full-blown comment war, then no, it's not the role of moderator to calm down these situations, <strong>it's the role of the moderator to stop/fix them with the tools given to them</strong>.</p>

<p>Additionally, it should be said that the SO community does a great job of policing these things themselves with flags, something that helps all moderators.  I believe in the flagging policy and the community's use of it.</p>

<p>There's little context around this, but low-quality posts degrade the system, and that is a bad thing.  Low-quality posts would be deleted.  Of course, ones which are debatable in quality would be discussed with fellow moderators and the community.</p>

<p>I think this case is simple, you don't deal with the user, you deal with the comments through moderation.  </p>

<p>If the user's overall net effect is negative (and extremely negative at that) <em>then you deal with the user</em>.</p>

<p>I don't consider myself addicted, but that's a subjective view.  My wife might consider otherwise. =)</p>

<p>Good ways are obvious; I get to contribute and help others, and I get to learn in the process.  That satisfies a core part of who I am.  </p>

<p>The bad ways?  Well, I joked about my wife earlier, but there are times I'm trying to put that finishing touch on an edit and it's not the most opportune time, and I might put off other things at times to do such things, but generally I can't say my life is out of balance because of it.  </p>

<p>I've already stated that if the content is of very low quality, then it should be deleted.  If the content is offensive or hateful in any way, it should be deleted.</p>

<p>However, there are a good number of times where the question might have a better life on another SE site, or if it is of questionably low quality, a nudge (in the form of a comment) can encourage a user to turn low-quality content into good content.</p>

<p>Deleting should be aggressive when the content is of an obviously detrimental nature to SO and the community; other means should be used when it is not.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It <em>is</em> a great feature, but it is not SO's <em>greatest</em> feature, IMO.  The vote is SO's greatest feature; so much of what is done on SO is predicated on the vote, it opens/closes gateways to so many other features which serve to encourage the community to help keep the system running in a healthy manner.</p>

<p>I love that we can edit posts and take great pride in doing it (as I've done it quite often), but to me, the vote and all that it enables is the single greatest feature of SO (IMO).</p>

<hr/>

<h2>General Philosophy</h2>

<p>This election, I didn't just ""throw my hat into the ring"", that was what I did the last time I nominated myself, not approaching it with the seriousness it deserves.  </p>

<p>Since then, there's been time to reflect on the position, and as to whether or not I truly want it.  My answer is a resounding ""yes"".  This time, I approach the election and the position with a seriousness, passion, and commitment that the position demands.</p>

<p>Reputation is important.  It's the quantifiable cornerstone of what Stack Overflow is built on.</p>

<p>The pursuit of reputation, however is not important.  What is of more importance are the actions one takes to foster the community in a positive direction (one of the reasons for the badge requirements, I gather, which I fully support).</p>

<p>That said, I've long been an advocate of improving the quality of the experience for <em>everyone</em> at SO; editing posts for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting code for readability, voting to close/migrate posts, flagging posts (<em>never</em> out of spite or malice, but always with the goal of improving the overall quality of the question and/or system).</p>

<p>These are things that there are no (or difficult to acquire) metrics for.  They are tedious and thankless, and yet still must be done in order to keep the quality bar high.</p>

<p>These are the tasks that I take joy in providing, knowing that the actions I take based on the care I have for a better experience have a real, lasting effect.</p>

<p>I am a passionate believer in the neutrality that a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/faq#editing"">collaborative, wiki-like site such as Stack Overflow</a> strives to maintain.  I believe in this so much so that I've <strong>never</strong> had a problem <strong>voting/flagging my own content for removal</strong> in order to improve the overall quality.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Why I believe I should be one of your next moderators</h2>

<p>I've never asked nor expected thanks.  This is why being a moderator is perfect for me.  I revel in the tasks that I know must be done (just look at my <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/50776/casperone?tab=reputation#page_1-view_graph"">reputation gain over the last year vs. the past two years</a>); the work is it's own reward.  </p>

<p>Being a moderator is allows me to do more of this work and on a greater scale.  It enables me to do what I love and provide for a better user experience for all.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about helping.  As a creator of a <a href=""http://sf4answers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Stack Overflow clone</a>, I've been able to combine my passion for technology and for helping others.</p>

<p>I'll bring that same passion to the moderator role when elected.</p>

<p>That's up to you!  Be aggressive and <strong>ask the questions in the comments that are important to you in the comments</strong>.</p>

8042241		"<p>I'd like to nominate myself for StackOverflow moderator. I am very active in the community -- mostly within the C# and general .NET tags -- and frequently help moderate questions and answers (either by improving them if possible or voting to close/delete or flagging) using the 10k+ user tools, but I feel like I would be a helpful addition to the formal moderating team.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>I've been a member of StackOverflow for more than two and a half years. In that time, I've committed myself to making SO a better site, and my interaction has (hopefully) been in line with that goal. </p>

<h3>Qualifications</h3>

<ul>
<li>I have a good handle on grammar and punctuation (son of an English teacher; sue me), and I try to give a helping hand to questions where the meaning is clear with some effort, but language issues might prevent them from getting the high-quality answers they deserve.</li>
<li>I am available during the peak StackOverflow hours (the workday in the western hemisphere) and frequently answer and moderate questions during this time.</li>
<li>I have experience with other forms of internet moderation (e.g. forum moderator, panel discussion facilitator, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moderation Policy</h2>

<p>While personally no stranger to the close vote (or delete vote when it's warranted), I tend to be fairly inclusive when it comes to the questions that I come across. Questions that are blatantly too broad (asking for someone to write a complete application, for example) I'll generally close--especially if they come from someone who's been around the block and should know better--but I'll also try to help the user either define what their question actually <em>is</em> or give a couple of suggestions to get them started so that they can come back with a specific technical question.</p>

<p>I think that moderation should take the long view; after all, the purpose of StackOverflow is to provide the internets with a resource for <em>finding solutions</em>, not necessarily asking questions. To that end, I generally tailor my moderation practices to favor questions that have a lasting, broad appeal, or those that strike a good balance between specificity and generality. With that said, I still personally try to help users (or at least point them in the right direction) even if their question isn't well suited to the site.</p>

<h2>So...now what?</h2>

<p>If you've taken the time to read my nomination, then thank you! I'm guessing, though, that I haven't answered all of your questions. If so (or even if not), please come to <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=schedule"">one of the scheduled Town Hall meetings</a> and ask away; I'm currently scheduled to attend the first meeting (Tuesday, 11/15/2011 at 9:00pm Eastern), but I will make every effort to attend the second meeting as well, assuming that work obligations allow for it.</p>

8044210		"<p>I believe I'd make a fair and useful moderator for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Time: I currently use Stack Overflow to fill what would otherwise be idle time. This typically replaces ""reading the news"" whilst eating breakfast/lunch, the 5-10 minutes whilst building/testing some new code. Stack Overflow filled a newsgroup sized hole in my habits when my local NNTP server got pulled because nobody else was using it any more! My usual time-zone is GMT/BST.</p></li>
<li><p>Active: I'm fairly active in the C++ and C++11 tags, although by no means the most active in either. As well as that I regularly look over the ""late answers to old questions"" list, looking for answers that need editing or look suspicious in some way (e.g. spam/sockpuppets). I have some experience in a number of other tags too, as well as basic sysadmin experience which I've used to raise flags to prevent inappropriate migrations to Server Fault in particular.</p></li>
<li><p>Badges: I have the requisite badges (and actually the gold equivalents of the silver ones too). I actually like that having got the gold flag weight badge I'm able to flag the problem posts that are less obvious - the ones that 9 times out of 10 get marked as helpful, but occasionally get disputed; which I avoided before getting the badges. I mostly like doing things because they're useful. Badges were a distraction from that, moderator access would increase the number of useful actions available.</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness: I feel I know my limitations. I'm fairly good at knowing when and where I should seek further advice. As an example one of the first things I did after getting access to the 10K tools was ask about how best to handle several borderline cases on chat and read a lot of meta posts about the 10K tools. I've also raised quite a few flags that ran along the lines of ""there are several problems here, (list of problems) - I'm not sure how best to proceed"" and then observed the action taken by moderators.</p></li>
<li><p>Fair and objective: In my view all of my actions to date on this site (and others on the network) have been objective and fair. I'm able to recognise the danger signs of losing that objectivity and step back to allow someone else to handle that and avoid escalating a situation into a conflict. In the past that's been through flagging (and a keen watch to see the result). As a moderator that would be walking away to let someone else handle it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Summary: I feel like I've seen how things work around here, I have time to offer and I'd like access to the moderator tools to convert my time into direct actions rather than simply adding them to somebody else's list of tasks.</p>"			3	2011-11-07 23:36:40.853000 UTC	2011-11-07 23:36:40.853000 UTC		2011-11-07 23:36:40.853000 UTC	2011-11-07 23:36:40.853000 UTC		168175		168175		6	250

<p>Vote for me, I'm willing to sweep the floors and keep on top of the flags queue. I'm also prepared to deal with the requests to <em>""plz merge my old Jon Skeet account with my new account, honestly it is my account""</em> and to clean up duplicate answers that have been sprayed around on vaguely related questions by new users.  </p>

<p>I know the life of a moderator is not just about glamour and hanging out with the groupies, it requires continuous work to keep the site tidy. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/109702/slugster?tab=activity"">Check out my activity</a> - you will see that I am continuously doing a lot of the housekeeping type work that could be expected from a moderator, it has earned me the <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/2042/users-eligible-for-2011-stack-overflow-moderator-elections"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>four badges</strong></a> mandatory for selection.</p>

<p>Also note my 700+ flag weight. What this bit of information <strong>really</strong> means is that not only do I do a reasonable volume of work, that work is of a good quality.

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong> In real life I am a senior level professional developer (i.e. I have been in the game a long time, lectured at TechEd, etc.), so I have a nose for sniffing out crap in questions and answers. I have previously moderated on other forums, dealing with the h4x0rs and crackers in the open discussion area on masmforum.com certainly helps build a thick skin and no nonsense approach. I am located in the bottom end of the world (new Zealand, not far from Australia), in a timezone that is nicely offset from the UK and USA, which means I can catch questions and clean-up while others are sleeping.</p>

<p>If you want to know how I roll, check out my answers in the <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112443/november-2011-moderator-election-town-hall-chat-digest-1"">Town Hall Chat Digest #1</a>.

<p><br/></p>

<h2>My agenda</h2>

<p>Let's face it, I don't want to become a moderator simply to get god like powers and that little diamond beside my moniker. I also have a couple of things I would like to achieve:  </p>

<ul>
<li>to really get the <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/108579/canonical-answers-for-repeated-questions"">canonical answer concept</a> going. There are some answers that really are so good that they should be recognised as THE answer, and subsequent duplicate questions should be pointed back to that original answer. Imagine if <strong>you</strong> get recognised as the author of one of these canonical answers! Once this gets traction I can see it improving the answer quality markedly as people strive to attain this.</li>
<li>There are a lot of old <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107712/old-best-book-resource-questions""><em>""What is the best ...""</em></a> type questions - many of these have limited relevance one or two years on, but some of them still have some value. These need to be rationalised, the goods ones kept and the bad ones 'cancelled'. </li>
</ul>

<p>These are goals that will take some time (and co-operation from fellow moderators and SO'ers) to achieve.</p>

<p>Due to the amount of time I already spend on the site over the day, being a moderator on Stack Overflow is not going to require any extra effort on my part, it will simply enable me to do a more comprehensive job than what I'm currently able to do. In addition to the current flow of work there is still a lot to be done cleaning up historical questions, and having moderator privileges will assist with that.

<p>I've been a web developer for well over a decade. The web is dynamic and always evolving. Because of that, Stack Overflow holds a special place in my heart as a place to teach and learn.</p>

<p>While my initial goals on Stack Overflow were to grow as a developer, I have also evolved. The time I spend here now revolves around improving content. My philosophy is that <em>a question that is well organized and concise attracts more quality answers</em>. Furthermore, the benefits progress how our questions are indexed by search engines.</p>

<p>One area which I believe needs a lot of love is tagging. I want to be more hands-on in SO's taxonomy, helping to bring content into the eyes of the subject matter experts. Content is only as good as it is accessible.</p>

<p>Hello world!  My name is Rocket (not really).  I've been a member of StackOverflow for almost 1.25 years.  I used to work as a Computer Science tutor in college, so I like to help people.  I currently work full time as a PHP/jQuery programmer.  Throughout my busy day at work, I am always on StackOverflow helping people where and when I can.</p>

<p>The community here has helped me with a lot of my programming projects and I love helping others.</p>

<p>I hate when you have a problem, so you Google it and the only thing you find is a forum post you made asking how to fix it.  I first found this site by Googling a Java problem I was having, and there were plenty of solutions.  I signed up to comment on the answer, and I immediately found myself wanting to answer others questions.</p>

<p>I am that guy who will keep staring at a file until that one little bug is fixed.  I can't remember the last time I left work when I'm supposed to.</p>

<p>I am aware that I don't have much of a presence on Meta, but I am always editing questions and answers to improve grammar and readability.  I also make sure to re-tag questions where I see fit.  If I see you using bad grammar or forgetting to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> code blocks, I'll go ahead and fix that.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Moderate in moderation, with a light touch but a firm hand, with patience, respect and fairness.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever possible, let the community make its own decisions, using the tools available to them, such as voting and closing.  Step in only when this self-moderation process fails.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull up the weeds, where I see them.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the end goal in mind, which is to make StackOverflow the best resource available to programmers on the planet.</p></li>

<p>I am guided by the principles set forth by Jeff and his team, and the guidelines discussed and developed on meta.stackoverflow.com, but I also trust my own instincts.  I will listen, and continue to learn, grow and improve.  </p>

<p>I am inspired by people like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/23354/marc-gravell"">Marc Gravell</a>, who not only moderates with grace and style, but also manages to find the time to contribute exceptionally good new material to StackOverflow on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I have been a member for the last 1 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> years, so i've got a good feel for the SO flow.</p>

<p>For me moderation is NOT about spending endless hours on SO editing posts, removing tags from post titles and reminding tardy users about 0% accept rates (i already do that).

I'm also in the timezone that is first to see the sunrise everyday, so like a ninja i'm around to action things when everyone else is asleep.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <br/>
my usage of the word 'damn' has drawn some comment, but it brings up a very interesting point: <strong>culture</strong>. It is important to remember that Stack Overflow has participants from many different cultures - not so that we can be politically correct, but so that we can <em>recognise something when said inadvertantly or taken out of its intended context</em>.</p>

<p>I used the word <em>damn</em> in a light hearted, informal, self-deprecating manner, which is culturally 100% legitimate where i come from. That doesn't mean i would use it in a conversation with my highly religious mother-in-law - that would be inappropriate.

<p>I would like to nominate myself, Kevin, for the moderator position.</p>

<p>I would like to be a moderator to better serve the community. I respect people, whether they are a beginner or a seasoned expert. I've been a beginner before, and I know the best way to be helpful to them is to be patient. Like anyone else, I make mistakes, and I have no intention of being bullish or unwilling to admit a mistake. Rather I think those traits strongly indicate someone well suited for moderatorship.</p>

<p>My most passionate concerns are ensuring beginners get a good experience, and keeping up with the moderation queue.

8045148		"<p>I was excited when Stack Overflow was first announced. I wasn't a regular reader of Coding Horror or Joel on Software. In fact, I slightly distrusted both of them for using Microsoft products<sup>1</sup>. But they both seemed competent <em>enough</em> to save us from the evils of Experts-Exchange, and I joined for the private beta (with user id 1114).</p>

<p>When the site launched I recommended it to everybody. I was happy with the site overall; I participated occasionally and made a few posts on UserVoice, but many of Joel and Jeff's decisions irritated me. They seemed arbitrary and bizarre, and reinforced my existing negative impressions of them.</p>

<p>A few years later (~six months ago) I <em>finally</em> ended up listening to an episode of the podcast. I can't remember why, it was probably recommended by some meta thread. As I listened, I was surprised. They actually sounded quite reasonable! I listened to more of the archive, and more, and then started reading old meta threads.</p>

<p>All of a sudden old decisions that had seemed random began to make sense. As I started to appreciate the philosophy of Stack Overflow I became more excited about the site and <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/users/851?tab=reputation"">my participation increased dramatically</a>. I had been transformed from an occasional user into a <strong>Fanatic</strong>! ;-)</p>

<p>Since then, I've been very active on Stack Overflow and Meta, picking up <strong>Electorate</strong> on both sites. Most of the answers I've contributed have been in <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>, for which I have silver badges, though I also browse many tags I'm inexperienced with to learn about them. I've spent a while reviewing and searching through old posts and have the <strong>Marshal</strong> badge for reaching 749 flag weight. It would be very satisfying to be able to act directly instead of just creating work for others.</p>

<p>I do my best to consider the site's philosophy and the community's consensus while editing. I don't have any <em>unique</em> plans for how I'd behave as a moderator; there's a lot of work to be done and I think I have the time, enthusiasm and competence to help. As a moderator, when I'm not sure how the community feels about an issue I'll look for and read previous meta discussions before taking action.</p>

<p>As a last point, I have <strong>Publicist</strong> on Stack Overflow and <strong>Announcer</strong> on several smaller Stack Exchange sites, accounting for tens of thousands of visits. I don't have much expertise to contribute on other Stack Exchange sites, so I try to contribute in ways like this.</p>

<h2>Self-nomination</h2>

<p>Hello Stack Overflow! I'd like to nominate myself as a candidate in this upcoming moderator election.</p>

<p>The key part of being a moderator here is having good judgement, and I think that's something I do have. I've got a flag weight of <s>almost</s> over 600 (which would be more if I flagged questions instead of closing them manually since I got that privilege) and only around 4 flags that have been deemed invalid (hopefully) showing that I know what belongs where here, when to close or to migrate, or what's rude, harassment, or spam. I've come across many things before that don't belong on Stack Overflow and should be deleted, and I could definitely help manage the abundance of poorly written or unconstructive items instead of having to delegate it to moderators.</p>

<p>Please don't let my age deter anybody. I can assure you that I'm just as mature as anyone else. Sometimes more so =)</p>

<p>So... vote minitech! I'll delete stuff and edit and close it and whatnot.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Self-promotion!!!</h2>

<p>If you think reputation and time spent here and things like that aren't important, don't read this section. Otherwise, please continue. =)</p>

<p>I've been on Stack Overflow for less than a year (a little over 7 months) but I've already hit the 10k mark for reputation. I'm a very active participator here, especially in <a href=""/questions/tagged/vb.net"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'vb.net'"" rel=""tag"">vb.net</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%23"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'c#'"" rel=""tag"">c#</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'javascript'"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/jquery"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'jquery'"" rel=""tag"">jquery</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/php"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'php'"" rel=""tag"">php</a>, and out of the some 210 days I've been registered I've visited 193 days, editing, reviewing, asking, and answering all the while.
