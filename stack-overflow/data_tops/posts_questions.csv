73210679,az acr login raises DOCKER_COMMAND_ERROR with message docker daemon not running,"<p>Windows 11 with wsl2 ubuntu-22.04.</p>
<p>In Windows Terminal I open a PowerShell window and start <code>wsl</code> with command:</p>
<pre><code>wsl
</code></pre>
<p>Then I start the docker daemon in this window with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dockerd
</code></pre>
<p>It prompts for the admin password, which I enter and then it starts the daemon.</p>
<p>Next I open a new PowerShell window in Windows Terminal, run <code>wsl</code> and run a container to verify everything is working. So far so good.</p>
<p>Now I want to login to Azure Container Registry with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>az acr login -n {name_of_my_acr}
</code></pre>
<p>This returns the following error:</p>
<pre><code>You may want to use 'az acr login -n {name_of_my_acr} --expose-token' to get an access token, 
which does not require Docker to be installed.

<p>The error suggests the daemon is not running, but since I can run a container I assume the deamon is running - otherwise I would not be able to run a container either, right? What can I do to narrow down or resolve this issue?</p>

73406942,Google workspace account has been suspended with no recovery method,"<p>Many years ago I set up my domain so Google would manage my domain's email.  Today, possibly because I was accessing from another state, Google decides to suspend the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your organization's Google workspace account has been suspended. Please contact your Google workspace organization administrator to re-activate your organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So since I'm the administrator, I try to logon with those credentials, which are correct, but they challenge me, and want me to complete an email loop, but <strong>the recovery email is in the locked domain!</strong></p>
<p>There seems to be no way to get this fixed. There's some code they can send me that I'm supposed to put my domain's server to prove I'm legit, but Google controls that...I have nothing on the domain except email. I'm paying Hover as the registrar.</p>
<p>Any way out?</p>
<p>I appreciate &quot;Only Google can help&quot;, but there's no path forward. No phone number, no button to &quot;open a ticket&quot;, no live chat. If you can't log on as administrator, none of that is available. How would a superuser get through on a problem like this?</p>
<p>There is a page that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get phone, chat, or email support for your legacy free account at xxxxxxx.com, you need to upgrade to Google Workspace.</p>

<p>But I can't log in as administrator to upgrade my account so I can get support because when I log in with correct credentials, they send a challenge to an email address that's in the locked domain!</p>
<p>I can't be the only one this happened to, so figure they're just hiding the path to victory so they don't have to answer too many phone calls.

<p>The above form accepts any email address, so you enter any email address that you currently have access to (not one that is locked, obviously).</p>

<p>So what it does Now
Users can create tickets
Only the Owner can see his ticket and edit it and anyone on the Admin Group</p>
<p>each Ticket has some messages
so what I want to do there
I want user and Admins can add Messages to a Ticket (user for owned tickets only )
Only Ticket Owner can see Ticket Messages ether its owner's message or message from admin</p>
<p>there is a built-in Owner-based Scope
but when I use it user can see messages from Admin

73460205,JS M2M OAuth2 client_secret protection,"<p>I have a node application running as an azure app service, with authentication enabled against the Microsoft IdP.</p>
<p>The node service has been exposed through an SPA API.</p>
<p>There is an other JS client application in the form of a browser extension that needs to communicate with the node server, without any prior user interaction (hence no auth. code flow or else)</p>
<p>The way it's handled now looks something like :</p>
<pre><code>  const myHeaders = new Headers
  ({
     Accept:&quot;application/json&quot;  
  })
  let pld = new FormData()
  pld.append(&quot;grant_type&quot;,&quot;client_credentials&quot;)

  pld.append(&quot;scope&quot;,&quot;https://login.microsoftonline.com/xxx/oauth2/v2.0/token&quot;)
  pld.append('client_secret',&quot;xxx&quot;)
  var url = &quot;https://example.net&quot; // The node JS URL

  let ret = fetch(url,{
    headers: myHeaders,
    method: &quot;POST&quot;,
    body: pld,
    mode: &quot;cors&quot;
  }).then((response) =&gt; {
      return response.then((data) =&gt; {
          // do some stuff
      )}
  })
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect this kind of service to service authentication flow to be quite common by nowadays standard, however i could not find in any of the docs i went through so far, how to properly secure the client_secret in order to get the access token.</p>
<p>If this is not the correct way to go then how are we supposed to make M2M authentication secure, without any user intervention ?</p>

The strange thing is that I have two websites structured in the same way. One works and the other does not.
Is there anyone who has encountered the same problem and solved it?
In that case I would like to ask him for help.

Now Firebase is stuck on &quot;loading&quot; after using any type of sign in. Real time database data is not showing as well. After around 5-10 of waiting auth will sometimes work continuously (can sign in, sign out multiple times, until running app again) but database never.<br>
Everything works well when i use physical device. Apps without firebase work fine on emulator. Internet connection works. Example app that doesn't work:<br> <a href=""https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android</a><br>

<li>Reinstalling Android Studio, installing win10 again</li>
<li>Updated Google Play services version</li>
<li>Tried different projects on different firebase accounts</li>
<li>Activated Sign-in methods in firebase console</li>
<li>Searched web for several hours and done many other things I can't even remember now</li>
</ol>
<p>The only error I'm sometimes getting is: <br><strong>E/FirebaseInstanceId: binding to the service failed</strong>
<br>and this error when I use new emulator for the first time: <br><strong>E/FirebaseMessaging: Topic sync or token retrieval failed on hard failure exceptions: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.io.IOException: AUTHENTICATION_FAILED. Won't retry the operation.

<br>E/FA: Missing google_app_id. Firebase Analytics disabled.

73408523,amCharts 4: How to get series tooltip to show between samples,"<p>We've recently upgraded our amCharts library from version 2 to version 4. In version 2, when the user hovered over the chart, the tooltips on the step line series showed up between the samples; whereas, in version 4, they only show up when the cursor is hovering exactly over one of the value points. (See screen shot.) We haven't changed our code in any appreciable way (other than what we had to do to get it to work with version 4), and we'd really like to get that old behaviour back, as it's difficult to get the cursor exactly over a data point in order to see what the value is. (Note: It's often the case in our charts that some series may have more data points than others in a given time/date range, as is the case in the screen shot, where the line series has more data points than the other two series.)</p>
<p>What can we do to get the tooltips on the various series in the chart to show up when the cursor is between data points? (It doesn't necessarily need to follow the cursor exactly as long as it shows up somewhere (e.g., on one or the other data point to either side of the cursor).)</p>
