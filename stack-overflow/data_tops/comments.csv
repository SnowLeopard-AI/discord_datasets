3690403,"-1 `$b = (&$a);` is invalid syntax. I know that's not your point, but `=&` is actually a single operator, and translates to the opcode `ASSIGN_REF`. This is not an irrelevant internals observation. Consider a function `func` that returns by reference `$a = func()`. This function is returning a reference, yet `$a` won't be a reference because the operator `=` breaks the reference set and clears the flag. You have to actually do `$a =& $func()`. `&` means ""make a reference out of this (e.g. `array(&$a)`), but making a reference is not enough to assign by reference.",2010-08-20 01:26:56.920000 UTC,3526643,127724,,11

If you declare the string variable ""as close as possible to where it's used,"" which is inside the loop, it will slow down your program because it will invoke the string's constructor each iteration through the loop.


If you declare the string variable at the top of the function, it will only invoke the constructor once, and it will be faster.",2010-08-20 02:32:14.010000 UTC,3506586,104474,,5
