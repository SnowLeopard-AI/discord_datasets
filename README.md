## About Snow Leopard

Snow Leopard is an AI-powered data platform that allows you to ask questions of, and fetch live data directly from, your structured data sources (SQL databases, data warehouses, etc.) in natural language. Here's how it works:

1. **Natural Language Input**: Ask questions about your data in plain English
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Snow Leopard creates a retrieval plan in real-time for what data is needed to answer your question
3. **Live Data Retrieval**: Snow Leopard generates and executes the necessary queries on the data source(s)
4. **Response Summarization**: Provides clear, actionable insights from your data
