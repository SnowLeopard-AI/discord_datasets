## About Snow Leopard

Snow Leopard is an LLM-powered data tool that allows you to ask questions and get data/summaries from your data in natural language. Here's how it works:

1. **Natural Language Input**: Ask questions about your data in plain English
2. **Execution Planning and Reasoning**: Snow Leopard creates a plan for what data is needed to answer your question
3. **Query Generation**: Writes, tests, and executes the necessary queries
4. **Response Summarization**: Provides clear, actionable insights from your data

**Why Snow Leopard?**
- Empower your LLM-based applications with enterprise data in real-time
- Access business data locked in databases and API systems
- Get fresh, accurate data for critical business decisions without pre-defined pipelines
- No ETL required - data is fetched on-demand
